# (Expose the package through an RPC API, select one and explain why have you chosen it.)
# - I choose JSON, because JSON that a PHP script generates can be very easily understood by a JavaScript script. It is the best way to transmit complex structures like arrays and objects, and have it still be compatible with multiple languages.

# Sql-file (msisdntask_number_inf1o.sql) with all dialling codes from Serbia, Croatia and Macedonia is in "db" directory.

# NOTE: With all of my efforts and lack of experience I couldn't configure docker/vagrant platform and distribute my application trough the container. Same thing with configuring PhPUnit and testing the application.
